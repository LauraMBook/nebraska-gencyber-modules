### Materials list

* [Gencyber Cyber Realm Card Deck](https://gencybercards.com)

### Learning Facilitation
Each item below is optional.

#### Warm up Activity
Discuss what first principles are in-general. For example this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle).

#### Focused Activity
Split students in groups of 4 or less. Hand a deck of cards to each group.

##### Game 1: Question Cards
- STEP 1: Ask the groups to further split their team into two sub-groups. Give each sub-group a card deck. Students in the sub-groups take turns to examine the cards with first principles on it.
- STEP 2: Use question cards (cards 1-20) of the one of the sub-group's decks as the question stack.
Shuffle these cards and place them face down in a stack to the left of sub-group 1.
- STEP 3: Turn a question card over
- STEP 4: Both sub-groups read the question and then place what they think the correct principle card is _face down_.
- STEP 5: When both sub-groups have placed the card down, then both can turn over their cards at the same time.
- STEP 6:
> - If both sub-groups picked the same principle they will put that question card face up to the right of the turned up question card area.  
> - If the principles don't match, the two sub-groups discuss and reach consensus. The sub-groups may invite the instructor if the mismatch cannot be resolved.

- Repeat steps 3 – 6 for all principle cards

##### Game 2: Cybersecurity Matrix

- STEP 1: Have them identify and examine the following cards
> Cards 22, 23, 24 are the characteristics of information  
Cards 25, 26, 27 are the states of information  

- STEP 2: Arrange these two sets of cards into an matrix as shown in the diagram below

![array](https://gencybercards.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/d1.jpg)

- STEP 3: Have students identify and examine the following cards
> Cards 31 – 39

- STEP 4: Now ask students to arrange the cards 31-39 as examples that fit at the cross section of the cards in the row and column. In the example below – Card 31 “Javier’s Concern” indicates that he wants to encrypt his hard drive. As such it is put in the first row first column since it cross references storage (hard drive) and encryption (confidentiality).
> Ask students to place cards in a Round Robin fashion. Internally discuss and resolve any disagreements. Each team must put all 9 cards down in the matrix within 5 minutes.

- STEP 5: Ask a group to share their solution. Discuss and resolve any disagreements raised by other groups using your answer key.  

- Now replace the `states of information` cards with the following cards that represent information countermeasures
> Cards 28, 29, 30 are information countermeasures  

- Repeat steps 4 and 5

#### Closure

Game Solution:
If there is a question as to where the card should be placed the answer is on the card – encrypted. For example on card 31 the lower right hand has the code XON21. This code is a simple rotation cipher and it rotated 21. You will get a three letter answer. In this case it will be CTS. The first letter will be either C, I, or A for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. The second letter will be P, E, or T for safeguards – Policy, Education or Technology. The third letter will be S, T or P for states – Storage, Transmission or Processing. In this case the answer is C for Confidentiality, and S for Storage.

- Ask students to share any examples related to the 10 first principles. Ask what other principle could be applicable in their example.

#### Reflection
Review how each cybersecurity first principles were demonstrated in this module.

### Assessment

- Students will demonstrate an understanding of Cybersecurity first principles through a game of Jeopardy/Kahoots Game. e.g. Quiz / Presentation / Project / Writing Assignment / Observation / Walk Around / Oral Questioning / Other

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

N/A

### Extension Activity(ies)

Point students to additional resources in the module.
